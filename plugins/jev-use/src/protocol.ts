/**
 * The jev-use handoff protocol.
 *
 * Jev (TypeSafe AI's System One model) answers typed questions about a state
 * in one forward pass — it never generates text. An LLM and Jev cooperate by
 * handing off:
 *
 *   LLM ──(state + typed questions)──▶ Jev        fast, cheap, calibrated
 *   Jev ──(verdict, escalate=true)──▶ LLM         when a boundary is hit
 *
 * Escalation is not an error: it is a typed signal that this step belongs to
 * the LLM. The boundaries, in the words the verdict uses:
 *
 *   - writing     : the step must produce new content (text, code, free-form
 *     tool arguments). Structurally impossible for Jev; decided BEFORE
 *     calling it.
 *   - open_ended  : the question cannot be expressed as noul / choice / score
 *     (no enumerable options, no ordered levels). Decided BEFORE calling.
 *   - oversized   : the state itself does not fit in Jev's context. Also
 *     decided BEFORE calling, for the whole batch.
 *   - unsure      : Jev answered but the distribution is too flat to act on.
 *     Decided AFTER calling, against the threshold for that answer's
 *     confidence source (see `ConfidenceSource`).
 *
 * Plus one operational reason, `unreachable`: Jev being down must degrade to
 * "the LLM handles it", never block the loop.
 *
 * Questions are written with the three builders at the bottom of this file —
 * `check` (noul), `pick` (choice), `rate` (score). The type names and wire
 * values keep Jev's own vocabulary; the builders only spell it in English.
