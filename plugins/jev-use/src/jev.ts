/**
 * The client. One `Jev` holds a resolved backend plus the defaults every call
 * inherits; questions are written with `check` / `pick` / `rate` and answers
 * come back keyed by the names you asked under.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const jev = new Jev();
 * const { answers } = await jev.judge(state, {
 *   next: pick("Next action?", { merge: "all green", rerun: "looks flaky", hold: "needs attention" }),
 *   passed: check("Did the run fully succeed?"),
 * });
 * answers.next.answer;  // "merge" | "rerun" | "hold" | null
 * ```
 *
 * This is a layer over the engine in `judge.ts` (screen → backend → hand back
 * what is unsure), not a second implementation of it. The wire surfaces — the
 * MCP tools, the pi tools, `jev-use judge` — call that engine directly, so
 * their JSON payload stays exactly the ordered `JudgeResult` an agent reads.
